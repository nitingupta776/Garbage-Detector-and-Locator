# Garbage-Detector-and-Locator
Garbage Detector and Locator Android App with Artificial Intelligence technology to save the environment

This project will be training a custom object detection model that can automatically identify various objects such as plastic, glass, metal, cardboard, paper, and other trash that is lying around and can be harmful to the environment. An Android app will be developed as the front-end that will use its camera to check the surrounding area and if any toxic materials will be detected or identified, then it will capture an image of that object along with its geolocation (latitude and longitude), and save all the information including the image, type of product (like it is recyclable or not), geolocation coordinates, time the image was taken into the Google Firebase Realtime database, that is a cloud-hosted NoSQL database. This application can also work in an offline mode, so if the app is not connected to the network, then it will save the information in the appâ€™s local database. All the information stored in the local database gets synced with the real-time database when the app establishes the connection with the internet again. This app also provides another interface in which all the locations of these objects will be marked on a map, and if the user will click on any of those markers, then it will display the image of that object and its complete information that was saved in the database.
